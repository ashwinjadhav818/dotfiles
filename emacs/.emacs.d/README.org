#+TITLE: ashwin's emacs config
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil

* Overview
This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration.  
It is mainly focused on Org-mode and Org-roam functionality. It is structured for readability and modularity, and it is managed as a subdirectory of my larger =dotfiles= repo.

The repo lives at:
#+begin_src shell
~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

* Features
- Modular configuration (split across =lisp/= and =lisp/packages/=).
- Package management with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].
- Custom evil keybindings, Org-mode setup.
- Optimized for performance (GC tweaks, lazy loading).
- Theming and UI tweaks for a clean editing experience.

* Installation
Clone the repo into your home directory:
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/ashwinjadhav818/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

* File Structure
#+begin_src text

* Usage
Start Emacs normally:
#+begin_src shell
emacs
#+end_src

Or use the daemon + client setup:
#+begin_src shell
emacs --daemon
emacsclient -c
#+end_src

  - Emacs Kick is the backbone of this config: a lightweight starter kit that provided the initial structure and package setup on which I built my own config.

  - Source of inspiration for modular organization, performance tweaks, and keybinding ideas.
