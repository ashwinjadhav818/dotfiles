;;; DIRED

;; that allows you to navigate and manipulate files and directories directly
;; within the editor. If you're familiar with `oil.nvim', you'll find that
;; `dired' offers similar functionality natively in Emacs, making file
;; management seamless without needing external plugins.

;; This configuration customizes `dired' to enhance its usability. The settings
;; below specify how file listings are displayed, the target for file operations,
;; and associations for opening various file types with their respective applications.
;; For example, image files will open with `feh', while audio and video files
;; will utilize `mpv'.

;;; ERC
;; In this section, we introduce ERC (Emacs Relay Chat), a built-in IRC client
;; that allows you to engage in real-time chat directly within Emacs. While
;; we're aiming to maintain functionality similar to Neovim, it's important to
;; recognize that Emacs is often viewed as more than just a text editor. Many
;; users leverage Emacs for a variety of tasks beyond editing text: from watching
;; videos and listening to music, to managing emails and even serving as a window
;; manager in Xorg, freeing themselves from traditional desktop environments.
;;
;; While this kickstarter focuses on essential configurations, I wanted to present
;; ERC as a glimpse into Emacs's versatility. With ERC, you can seamlessly connect
;; to IRC channels and interact with communities without leaving your editor.

;;; ISEARCH

;; - `C-r' to initiate a backward search
